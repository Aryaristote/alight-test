# Alight Full-Stack-Challenge


# FullStack Challenge (Javascript/Typescript) MERN

  üìù Create a full web application using the following stacks:

        - Back-end: Use any Javascript or Typescript framework/library you are comfortable with (or any technology)
        - Front-end: Use any front-end framework/library you are most comfortable with.

* In this challenge, you have the flexibility to choose whether to work on the frontend, the backend, or both.
  However, completing the frontend portion is mandatory, while developing the backend is considered an added bonus.
  If you opt not to use your own endpoint, you are welcome to utilize an API or theme that you find suitable for your project.
  The key is to ensure that the frontend is well-implemented, responsive, and aligned with the provided designs.

### üë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBest Practices

- Document your API eg: [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), Postman
- Apply validation (and email should be validated).
- The system should throw an exception if any error occurs.
- Properly log your application.
- Do not hard code any sensitive data (eg: env variables).
- Write a good README file with the steps to Install, Test & run your application (steps for docker included)


### ‚ú®Bonus
- Full Stack App (Frontend + Backend): Doing both frontend and backend work is extra good. You need to do frontend, but if you also do backend, it's even better.
- Fit on Small Screens: Making sure the app works on small screens is important. Adding extra screens for small screens gets extra points. It shows you care about everyone being able     to use the app.
- Adding Backend: While the main focus is on making the front part, adding a backend for support is great. It helps with storing data and other things, and it gets you more points.
